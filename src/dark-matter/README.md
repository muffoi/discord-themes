# Dark Matter
A remake of an [eponymous BetterDiscord theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Dark%20Matter).

This remake includes various fixes, such as:
- Not working **transparency**
- Discord's custom Windows **window title bar** lacking color
- **Rounded borders** that look bad with transparent themes
- Too big **scrollbars**
- **Unaligned items** in server list

**Note: The *Visual Refresh* experiment is not supported by this theme yet. No compatibility is guaranteed.**
